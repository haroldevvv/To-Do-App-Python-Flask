# To-Do App using Python and Flask

## Description
A simple to-do app built with Python using the Flask framework. The app allows users to create, edit, and manage their tasks. This project is part of my capstone project portfolio and is designed to showcase my skills in web development using Flask and various technologies.

Current functionality only allows user to edit tasks in a single master to do list. For future improvements, I'd consider creating a functionality to manage different to do lists (like a traditional Reminders app) and viewing completed tasks.

## Usage
1. Run the app: `python main.py`
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. Interact with the app to create, edit, and manage your tasks.

## Features
- Create tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- Edit existing task's description and due dates.
- Mark tasks as completed (which will also remove them from your lists).

## Future Improvements
After I tackle a few other projects, I'd consider enhancing the app in the future, including:
- Give user ability to sort to-dos by name, due status, or due date.
- Give user ability to create different lists with to do tasks.
- Give user ability to move tasks between lists.
- Allow user to view completed tasks within each list.
- Allow user to edit and delete lists. 
- Update the homepage to display all to-do lists and when user clicks on a list, it will take them to a unique url with that to do list.
- Adding user authentication for personalized task management.
- Implementing task categorization and filtering.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- HTML
- Bootstrap (CSS Framework)

## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges of creating this app was writing html and css code. I'm also not very familiar with bootstrap framework so it took a lot of experimenting and debugging to get the app going. 

For example, I initially used HTML tables to display the list of tasks, but I couldn't get it to display the way I wanted. I found a work-around by using containers and divs. Here's what an earlier draft looked like:
